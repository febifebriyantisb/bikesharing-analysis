## Project Overview
Bike sharing systems represent a new generation of traditional bike rentals, where the entire process—from membership and rental to return—has become automated. These systems allow users to rent a bike from one location and return it to another seamlessly. With over 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide, comprising more than 500,000 bicycles, these systems have garnered significant interest for their potential impact on traffic management, environmental sustainability, and public health.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze data generated by bike sharing systems to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform decision-making for urban mobility, environmental planning, and public health initiatives. By leveraging the detailed records of travel duration, departure, and arrival positions, this project aims to turn bike sharing systems into a virtual sensor network that senses and reflects city mobility.

## Methodology
1. Data Gathering
2. Data Assessing and Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data Visualization using seaborn and matplotlib
5. Create dashboard

## Expected Outcomes
1. Understanding the impact of external factors (e.g., weather, public events) on bike-sharing demand
2. Insights into peak usage times
3. Identification of key usage patterns and trends in bike-sharing systems

## How to Run the Project Locally
### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/febifebriyantisb/bike-sharing-analysis.git
   cd bike-sharing-analysis
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### Running the Analysis
1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Open the notebook file:**
   - Navigate to `Data_Analysis_febifebriyantisb.ipynb` in your browser and open it.
### Running the Dashboard
1. **Navigate to the dashboard directory:**
